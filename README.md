#ximbled ghost blogging box

ximbled created a ghost 0.7.X.X environment (Vagrant Box) to allow developers
to quickly spin up a working version and toy around with theme creation.

There wasn't really a suitable box out there, core ghost development relies on a very broken Vagrant setup.

Theme development is kind of a new field for me. I'm enjoying it but needed something like this that was easily distributed amongst the (very) small team.
